## Cameras and Microphones Are All You Need

## WARNING

I believe that AI systems must be fully integrated into your environment to truly enhance its users. 
This causes issues when building ML and LLMs into products because you must violate all privacy of the user.

Realizing this, I have decided to build it myself. Anyone is welcome to try this for themselves obviously, but dont come crying to me when your entire life is used as training data for GPT-5. 

USE AT YOUR OWN RISK!

## Initial Implementations (more to come)

### Business desk:
   - Automatic OCR when documents are placed in the "IN" Document Bin
   - Keep track of what I was previously working on because I never remember and no app exists that does this well.

### Ceramic 3D printer:
   - Natural language to 3d printed object.
   - Monitor the success or failure of prints.
   - Log Glaze Reicpies
   - Log Kiln Settings
   - Log Weather Data during firing process

### Plotting Robot:
   - Natural language to SVG text/image that is routed to the robot.
   - Ask my AI write personalized thank you letters to clients using the pen plotter.
   - Ask my AI to create drawing mockups for new project ideas I am working on.

### Office kitchen:
   - Monitor the contents of my refrigerator and tell me what to make based on available ingredients, previous meals, and expiration dates.
   - Tell me when it's time to load the dishes into the dishwasher.
   - Tell me when the dishwasher cycle is complete.
   - Monitor my coffee consumption and the amount of coffee left in the pot.

### Backyard and parking area:
   - Monitor my two dogs' activities to ensure their well-being and safety.
   - Track both of my vehicle usages for maintenance and scheduling.
   - Tell me to take the trash out on the designated day and time.
   - Tell me if someone other than me or my wife are in the backyard or parking area.

## Expanded Uses and Long-term Analysis

Capabilities extend beyond daily tasks and can provide valuable insights through long-term data analysis. 
By continuously monitoring various aspects of your life and work, 
identify patterns, optimize processes, and help you make informed decisions.

1. **Productivity Analysis**
   - Track the time spent on different tasks and projects
   - Identify productivity patterns and suggest improvements
   - Monitor progress towards long-term goals and deadlines

2. **3D Printing Optimization**
   - Analyze the success rate of prints over time
   - Identify common issues and suggest preventive measures
   - Optimize print settings based on historical data

3. **Pen Plotting Art Evolution**
   - Track the progression of your pen plotting art style
   - Identify popular designs and themes based on client feedback
   - Suggest new design ideas based on previous successful projects

4. **Coffee Consumption Insights**
   - Analyze coffee consumption patterns over time
   - Identify factors influencing coffee intake (e.g., workload, stress)
   - Suggest optimal coffee consumption for productivity and well-being

5. **Kitchen Inventory Management**
   - Track the usage of ingredients over time
   - Predict when certain items will run out and suggest restocking
   - Identify rarely used items and suggest recipes to minimize waste

6. **Pet Behavior Analysis**
   - Monitor changes in your dogs' behavior and activity levels
   - Identify potential health issues or behavioral changes
   - Suggest adjustments to pet care routines based on insights

7. **Vehicle Maintenance Scheduling**
   - Track vehicle usage and maintenance history
   - Predict when certain maintenance tasks will be required
   - Suggest optimal times for scheduling maintenance appointments
